= NationalParks backend application
This application is a backend that provides geolocation information about NationalParks. The information is stored in a mongodb


== Installation
As the application needs to interact with openshift's API, you'll need to provide some permissions to the default ServiceAccount for that.

Assuming you're using the project <roadshow>:

----
oc new-project roadshow
oc policy add-role-to-user view system:serviceaccount:roadshow:default
oc create -f ./ose3/application-template.json
oc new-app nationalparks
----

There's some options that can be parameterized:

* APPLICATION_NAME: Name of the application
* MAVEN_MIRROR_URL: Url of a maven mirror 
* APPLICATION_HOSTNAME: Hostname/route to access your application

Example:

----
oc new-app nationalparks -p APPLICATION_HOSTNAME=nationalparks-roadshow.127.0.0.1.xip.io -p MAVEN_MIRROR_URL=http://nexus.ci:8081/content/groups/public
